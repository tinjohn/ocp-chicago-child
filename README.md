# ocp-chicago-child-theme-wp
ocp-chicago-child is a Wordpress child theme for the [Chicago theme](https://de.wordpress.org/themes/chicago/) by Catch Plugins

![alt text](ocp-chicago-child/screenshot.png "Screenshot of the child theme")


Due to little success with the manual creation of a working child theme based on an already customized chicago theme, the skeleton was created with the help of Catch Plugins own child theme generator WordPress plugin: [Generate Child Theme](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/generate-child-theme/).  

Requirements
-------------
* a running wordpress installation
* [chicago theme](https://de.wordpress.org/themes/chicago/) installed

Installation
-------------
* copy the ocp-chicago-child folder to your wp-content/themes/ directory
* check your theme settings page for the new appearing theme ocp-chicago-child
* activate the ocp-chicago-child theme
* additional customization in the WordPress theme customizer:
  * add header image
  * set color (color pane) to light / hell

Troubleshooting
----------------
* if there was any difference to the theme screenshot, try to import chicago-export.dat to the theme using the import function provided in the customizer after installing and activating the WordPress plugin [Customizer Export/Import](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/customizer-export-import/) by The Beaver Builder Team.
