# ocp-chicago-child
Wordpress child theme for Chicago template

Due to little success with the manual creation of a really working chicago theme based child theme, the skeleton was created with the help of Catch Plugins own child theme generator wordpress plugin: [Generate Child Theme](https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/generate-child-theme/).  

Requirements
-------------
* a running wordpress installation
